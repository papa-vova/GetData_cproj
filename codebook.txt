Subject
	Identifies the subject who performed the activity.
	Type: integer
	Range: from 1 to 30

Activity
	Identifies activity performed by the subject.
	Type: character
	Values:
		WALKING
		WALKING_UPSTAIRS
		WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
		SITTING
		STANDING
		LAYING

Fields from 3 to 68:
	Averages of means and standard deviations of signals
	(on the basis of which the Activity was determined)
	
	The data from the train and test subsets of the UCI HAR Dataset
	were merged, and only mean and std dev fields were left in.
	(Look for the complete description of features in the file
	features_info.txt in the UCI HAR Dataset).
	
	'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions
	'-mean' at the end of field name indicates that the component was averaged
	after grouping by Subject and Activity
